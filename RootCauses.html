                <p>
                  Out of 400 public elementary school teachers that teach financial literacy, a study found that only 62% of teachers passed a financial literacy questionnaire that covers taxes, insurance, consumer finances, and financial planning and responsibility.

                  The degree of a teacher's own financial literacy has an impact on how effectively teachers deliver financial education.

                  “Current elementary school textbooks cannot cultivate sufficient financial management knowledge in elementary school students, suggesting the unsuitability of financial education curricular materials for elementary school teachers.”

                  When teachers must develop their own lessons because there are no appropriate resources available, they may skip important ideas and make financial literacy education unstandardized.

            <p>
              With twenty-three states requiring financial literacy classes, the government should provide more training to teachers and student learning materials they can use in their classrooms.

                <h4>Evidence</h4>
                <p>
                  In the famous 1972 Stanford marshmallow experiment by psychologist Walter Mischel and his team, young children were told not to eat the marshmallow until later to test their ability to exercise self-control while a researcher left the room. The child was told that if they could hold out, they would be rewarded with two marshmallows when the researcher returned.
                  <p></p>
<p>In the 2013 follow-up marshmallow study shows that delayed gratification did significantly correlate with traits of self-control and better financial decisions.</p>

                <p>
                  Despite the fact that Mischel did not take into account additional elements that would have had a significant impact on those results, this psychological study is relevant to personal finance. When people are able to control their impulsive behavior, they are more likely to have a better financial future.

                  “Compulsive buying disorder (CBD) is characterized by excessive shopping cognitions and buying behavior that leads to distress or impairment. Found worldwide, the disorder has a lifetime prevalence of 5.8% in the US general population.”

            <p>
              It will be helpful for people to be self-aware if there is a website that defines compulsive buying disorder, delayed satisfaction, and its implications. Additionally, the website should include information on actions they can take to change their financial behavior.
