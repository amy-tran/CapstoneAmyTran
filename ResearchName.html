      <h1>My Question</h1>
      <p>
        How can we teach low-income young adults to build a good credit score?
      </p>
      <h1>Here's Some Context</h1>
      <p>A credit score is a number for 300 to 850 that depicts a consumer's creditworthiness based on their credit history. The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to lenders. They affect whether you get approved for credit cards, loans, and mortgages, and influences the interest rate and terms you get.
        Almost one in two adults do not have a credit card or have low credit scores due to ineffective financial literacy education and impulsive shopping habits. However, people with low-credit card scores pay thousands more in interest when borrowing money. We need to effectively help people get higher credit card scores by teaching them in an engaging way.</p>
      <h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
      <p>A website similar to Khan Academy that educates young adults (ages 18-24) about credit cards.</p>
