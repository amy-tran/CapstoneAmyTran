          <h4>Claim</h4>
          <p>
            The most effective solution seems to effectively provide credit card information to young Americans.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Since people have longer lifespans now, we need more money for retirement than earlier generations did. To save money, we should aim to get a good credit score to get lower interest rates and better terms on loans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row border-bottom border-dark border-2 effectiveSolution">
          <h4>Most Effective</h4>
          <p>
            Getting financially literate teachers to educate young adults on credit cards with effective learning materials provides them the knowledge and resources to make the best financial decisions for them.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As there are more investment and savings options now than ever, getting help from a trusted and knowledgeable person is beneficial.</p>

        <div class="row border-bottom border-dark border-2 technologyUses">
          <h4>Use of Technology</h4>
          <p>
            Technology can be used to spread awareness of peopleâ€™s spending behaviors and the negative impacts it has on their credit card scores, as well as prevention tips and remedies for low credit card scores.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>People are on their phones and other devices for dozens of hours per week.</p>

          <h4>Implications for My Project</h4>
          <p>
            The best way to spread awareness is to make a website similar to Khan Academy that educates young adults (ages 18-24) about credit cards and share it through word-of-mouth and social media.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>By marketing my educational website, I can help many people from all over the United States at once.</p>
