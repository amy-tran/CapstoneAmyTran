    <h1>Root cause #1: Financial literacy</h1>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>Twenty-three states require financial literacy classes, and twenty-five states require economics classes. </p>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Almost half of Americans do not receive financial literacy education. Some places that do have financial literacy classes do not teach effectively for the students, so states decide not to implement them.</p>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>People make avoidable financial mistakes.</p>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>People do not have the resources or knowledge that they need to avoid these mistakes.</p>
    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <p>More states can require financial literacy classes. However, they can show limited benefits, so classes should be more interactive, like having stock market simulations.</p>
    <h1>Root cause #2: Human behavior</h1>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>People who delay gratification tend to be more future-oriented and voluntarily participate in financial education.</p>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>People may participate in impulsive shopping because they enjoy it, even though they know itâ€™s bad.</p>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>People may be motivated to make choices based on how others perceive their decisions.</p>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>People want to seem well off, so they purchase expensive items on credit and are unable to pay back.</p>
    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <p>Credit card companies can give real-time notifications about just-incurred charges and upcoming and ongoing fees. Employers can also provide worksheets to help their employees make plans about loan repayments.
